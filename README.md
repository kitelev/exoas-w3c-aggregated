# exoas-w3c-aggregated — W3C standard-vocabulary anchors AssetSpace

**Anchors for standard W3C vocabularies, for [Exocortex](https://github.com/kitelev/exocortex).** This repository is an **AssetSpace** — a git-backed package of vault assets you mount into an Exocortex vault. It provides local, UID-named anchor assets for the well-known W3C terms (RDF, RDFS, OWL, SHACL, XSD) so that Exocortex assets can reference them and resolve their links inside the vault.

> **Where this fits.** Exocortex stores its graph as Markdown assets and resolves wikilinks against assets that exist in the mounted AssetSpaces. To reference a standard term like `rdfs:subClassOf` *as a resolvable link* (not a dangling reference), the term needs an asset to point at. This AssetSpace supplies those anchors. It is a **floor** AssetSpace (mounted with `exoas-exo`). See the engine's [Exo-as-SDK topology](https://github.com/kitelev/exocortex/blob/main/docs/explanation/assetspace-sdk-topology.md).

## What's in here

A single namespace folder, `w3c-aggregated/`, with one anchor asset per standard term, grouped by source vocabulary:

| Vocabulary | Anchored terms |
| --- | --- |
| **RDF** | `rdf__Statement`, `rdf__subject`, `rdf__predicate` |
| **RDFS** | `rdfs__Class`, `rdfs__Resource`, `rdfs__subClassOf`, `rdfs__subPropertyOf`, `rdfs__domain`, `rdfs__range`, `rdfs__isDefinedBy` |
| **OWL** | `owl__NamedIndividual`, `owl__ObjectProperty` |
| **SHACL** | `sh__severity` |
| **XSD** | `xsd__Date` |

> These are deliberately thin **anchors**, not full vocabulary imports — just enough for Exocortex assets to make resolvable references to the standard terms they actually use. The set grows as more terms are referenced.

## Using this AssetSpace

You don't clone this repo into your vault by hand — it is mounted through Exocortex, and as a floor AssetSpace it travels with the standard bootstrap / profile flow:

- **CLI:** `npx @kitelev/exocortex-cli assetspace-add --vault ~/vault --url https://github.com/kitelev/exoas-w3c-aggregated` (or pulled in as a dependency when you apply a Profile).
- **Plugin:** command palette → **Exocortex: Add a knowledge pack**, or apply a Profile that includes it.

Once mounted, its namespace appears under `assetspaces/kitelev/exoas-w3c-aggregated/w3c-aggregated/`, and the standard terms resolve as links in SPARQL and layouts.

## Conventions (for contributors)

- **UID-canon.** Every anchor is a UUID-named file (`<exo__Asset_uid>.md`); the term's name lives in `exo__Asset_label` (e.g. `rdfs__subClassOf`).
- **Add a term when you reference it.** New anchors are added on demand — when an Exocortex asset needs to point at a W3C term that isn't yet anchored.
- **CI.** Pushes run the shared [AssetSpace SHACL gate](https://github.com/kitelev/exoas-ci) (`validate schema --shapes-mode`).
